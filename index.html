        <h2>49ers Star Running Back Christian McCaffrey Sidelined by Soft Tissue Injury in Training Camp</h2>

        <p><strong>Published:</strong> August 20, 2024 | <strong>Author:</strong> 49ers Communications</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Santa Clara, CA</strong> – The San Francisco 49ers have announced that All-Pro running back
                Christian McCaffrey sustained a soft tissue injury during a recent training camp session. The injury
                occurred while McCaffrey was participating in non-contact drills at the team's practice facility in Santa
                Clara.</p>

            <p>Team medical staff evaluated McCaffrey on-site and diagnosed him with a moderate hamstring strain. The
                injury is considered moderate, and the medical team expects McCaffrey to miss 2-4 weeks of training and
                preseason action. He will begin a rehabilitation program immediately.</p>

            <p>Head Coach Kyle Shanahan addressed the media after Tuesday's practice, saying, "Christian has been
                putting in the work and preparing himself for the upcoming season. We are going to take this injury day
                by day, making sure he comes back when he's fully ready. His health is our priority, and we have full
                confidence in our medical team to get him back on the field."</p>

            <p>McCaffrey will miss the upcoming preseason games against the Denver Broncos and the Los Angeles Chargers,
                but he is expected to be fully ready for the regular season opener.</p>

            <p>The team's medical staff will continue to monitor McCaffrey’s progress closely, working with the running
                back on a treatment plan that focuses on physical therapy, strengthening, and conditioning exercises.

            <h3>Comments from McCaffrey</h3>

            <p>"I'm disappointed to be sidelined, especially with the season around the corner," McCaffrey said. "But
                I'll be focusing on my rehab and doing everything possible to be ready for Week 1."</p>
